What is this?
======================

A todo list web application which achieves an effect of the iOS Clear app(Firefox only).

The original iOS Clear app: http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/

How did I do this?
====================
I used Backbone.js as the framework to define the whole structure.
I used RequireJS to make the whole app modular.
I used CSS3 3D transformation to achieve the 3D rotation effect.
I wrote all the UI code from scratch(jQuery UI sucks!).
I used HTML5 localstorage to persist the data.

Something to improve?
======================
As there are several interactions in this app, like drag, sort, swipe, and I wrote these interaction code all by myself(maybe not that robust), sometimes one will interfere with another.
HTML5 localstorage is very convenient but not that powerful, there are some small synchronization issues when you update your data in the app.
